# GUI-Project

- In the first part I use mouse events, QPainter, signals and slots to create a GUI with a square that can be dragged around the window.
- Double-clicking the square brings up a color picker dialog box that allows you to change the square’s color.
• In the second part, I use QTimer to help create an animation of a ball bouncing around inside a window.
